--Problem STATEMENT
/*
Given a table STATION that holds data for five fields namely ID, CITY, STATE, NORTHERN LATITUDE and WESTERN LONGITUDE.
+-------------+------------+
| Field       |   Type     |
+-------------+------------+
| ID          | INTEGER    |
| CITY        | VARCHAR(21)|
| STATE       | VARCHAR(2) |
| LAT_N       | NUMERIC    |
| LONG_W      | NUMERIC    |
+-------------+------------+
where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Sample Input

For example, CITY has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY.

Sample Output

ABC 3
PQRS 4
Explanation

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with lengths  and . The longest name is PQRS, but there are  options for shortest named city. Choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

Note
You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query.

--Solution
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM (SELECT CITY FROM STATION ORDER BY  length(CITY), CITY ASC) as city LIMIT 1;
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM (SELECT CITY FROM STATION ORDER BY  length(CITY) DESC) as city LIMIT 1;
